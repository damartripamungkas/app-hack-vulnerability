### 🧾 Pre-Requisistes:
- node.js v20.x
- select one or all: windows x64, linux x64, macos x64

### 🏁 Started 
1. npm install -g pkg@5.8.1 
2. npm run compile:win or see command in file package.json
3. see file config.js
4. running file executable

### 📖 Description : 
if you have a compiled application and have a paid license_key system and if the user enters the wrong license_key then the program stops by calling ```process.exit()``` this information good for you.

### 🔥 Caused : 
run untrusted code then the data is entered into ```require``` or ```eval```

### 🥃 Effect : 
script does not exit even after calling ```process.exit()```

### 💡 Solution :
- declare ```process.exit``` in variable, but maybe the above code will be useless if you use minify like ```terser```, example:
```javascript
const processExit =  require("node:process").exit;
processExit(); // will exit
```  

- destructuring assignment exit from process, example:
```javascript
const { exit } =  require("node:process");
exit(); // will exit
```

- use 3rd party package ```isolated-vm``` for safe running untrusted code, example:
```javascript
const ivm =  require("isolated-vm");
```
